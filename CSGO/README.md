# CSGO-AC
Proof of concept Anti-Cheat plugin for CS:GO (Windows/Linux).

# Idea
Store CS:GO .data inside your anti-cheat plugin module  
that allows you to decrypt/encrypt data / virtualize the dll. it would make external cheating more difficult.  

This proof of concept is only doing it for ClientState ViewAngles, but there is no limits what you can do.  
I would assume doing the same for player positions would be enough.  

credits: 5EWIN/GC, they already do something like this.
